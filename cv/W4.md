From RGB to Grey: How to preserve order. $c (R, G, B) \to y $

We need to minimize the loss of information. $||\delta c|| \sim ||\delta y||$

To preserve trivial order, if $R_1 \le R_2, G_1 \le G_2, B_1 \le B_2$, then $y_1 \le y_2$

We use max likelihood to write as:

$$
\Pi_{i=1}^n \{\alpha_{x,y} G(\delta_{x,y}, \sigma^2) + (1 - \alpha_{x,y}) G(-\delta_{x,y}, \sigma^2) \}
$$

where $\alpha_{x,y} = 1$ if $x \ge y$, and $\alpha_{x,y} = 0.5$ if no order.

...

Utilizing the fact that images are often low-frequency, we can use low-level taylor expansion to approximate the function.

When there is $A(w)w + B(w) = 0$, we may iterate by $w = (A(w)^{t} A(w))^{-1} A(w)^{t} B(w)$.
