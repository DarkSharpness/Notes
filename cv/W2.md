## Face recognition

Traditional methods:

Image space -> semantic space.

why cnn use convolutions? (locality, translation invariance(平移不变性))

Dictionary learning.

Some facts about CNN:

- layer 1: corner
- layer 2: some global information
- layer 3: more and more global information (object)
- layer 4: maybe about scene information(?)

Maxpooling: reduce the size of the image.

Stride: the step of the convolution.

Data scale + Algorithm + Computation Power.

2 dimensions development

- Image -> Video -> RGBD(with depth information, 3D) -> Robotics (embodied ?)
- Pixel level -> Patch level -> Object level (recognition) -> Human understanding.

## History of computer vision

Digital Camera

Today: photon sensors are CCD, CMOS.

Color spaces: `RGB` `L*a*b` (色环?) 基于色系检测?
