# Week 4 of quantum computing

## Dirac notation

- $z^{*}$ Complex conjugate of $z$
- $|\psi\rangle$ Ket vector (Column vector)
- $\langle\psi|$ Bra vector (Vector dual to ket vector) (Row vector)
- $\langle\psi|\phi\rangle$ Inner product of two vectors
- $|\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle$ Tensor product of two vectors
- $A^{*}$ Complex conjugate of matrix $A$
- $A^{T}$ Transpose of matrix $A$
- $A^{\dagger}$ Herminitian conjugate of matrix $A$
- $\langle\psi|A|\phi\rangle$ Expectation value of operator $A$ in state $|\phi\rangle$.

Note that $\langle\psi|$ is the **conjugate transpose** of $|\psi\rangle$.

What is tensor product:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b \\
\end{bmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{bmatrix}
c \\
d \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a \begin{bmatrix} c \\ d \end{bmatrix} \\
b \begin{bmatrix} c \\ d \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Which is a linear combination of $|0\rangle|0\rangle$, $|0\rangle|1\rangle$, $|1\rangle|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle|1\rangle$.

qubit: $H = \text{span}\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$

## Basic assumptions

### Assumption 1

Postulates 1: System is comletely described by a state vector $|\psi\rangle$. Which is a unit vector in a Hilbert space.

$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$ where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$ and $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

$$
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\alpha \\
\beta \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Commmonly used states:

$$
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \\
|-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
$$

Trivially, we have $\langle + | + \rangle = 1$ and $\langle - | - \rangle = 1$. Also, $\langle + | - \rangle = 0$ and $\langle - | + \rangle = 0$.

So we can also claim that $H = \text{span}\{|+\rangle, |-\rangle\}$.

### Assumption 2

Postulates 2: Evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary transformation. That is, the state $|\psi\rangle$ at time $t_1$ is related to the state $|\psi'\rangle$ at time $t_2$ by a unitary operator $U$.

$|\psi'\rangle = U|\psi\rangle$.

unitary operator: $U^{\dagger}U = I$

Matrix:

$$
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can check that $H^{\dagger}H = I$. And we have $H|0\rangle = |+\rangle$ and $H|1\rangle = |-\rangle$.

This is called **Hadamard gate. (H-gate)**

### Block sphere

We denote $|\phi\rangle = (\cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle) e^{i\gamma}$.

We have $2$ remaining degrees of freedom ($\theta$ and $\phi$), so we can represent them in the surface of a sphere.

In such a sphere, the north pole is $|0\rangle$ and the south pole is $|1\rangle$. The equator of $x$-axis is $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$.

#### Some intuitions

$|\phi\rangle = (\cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle)$

Rotate around $x$-axis: Left multiply by $\sigma_x = X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

Rotate around $y$-axis: Left multiply by $\sigma_y = Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

Rotate around $z$-axis: Left multiply by $\sigma_z = Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$

These are called **Pauli matrices**.

### Some other stuff

If transpose conjugate of a matrix is equal to the matrix itself, then it is called a **ehrmitian matrix**.

Of course, hadamard gate is ehrmitian.

We treat $e^{i\theta}|\psi\rangle$ as $|\psi\rangle$ because it only changes the global phase. (We can not distinguish them by any measurement.)

**Phase gate**: $S = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{bmatrix}$

**$\frac{\pi}{8}$ gate**: $T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \end{bmatrix}$ (Why called so? Because it equals to $\begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\frac{\pi}{8}} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\frac{\pi}{8}} \end{bmatrix}$)

### Assumption 3

Postulates 3: Measurement of a quantum system is described by a set of measurement operators $\{M_m\}$. These are operators acting on the state space of the system being measured. The index $m$ refers to the measurement outcomes that may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is $|\psi\rangle$, then the probability that result $m$ occurs is given by $p(m) = \langle\psi|M_m^{\dagger}M_m|\psi\rangle$. The state of the system after the measurement is $\frac{M_m|\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{p(m)}}$.

A set of measurement operators should satisfy $\sum_m M_m^{\dagger}M_m = I$.

Common measurement operators:

- $M_0 = |0\rangle\langle 0| = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $M_1 = |1\rangle\langle 1| = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

For $|\phi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}$, we have $p(0) = |\alpha|^2$ and $p(1) = |\beta|^2$.

> Remark: All these measurements may not be orthogonal.

### Assumption 4

Postulates 4: The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component physical systems. Moreover, if we have systems numbered $1$ through $n$, and system number $i$ is prepared in state $|\psi_i\rangle$, then the joint state of the total system is $|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes |\psi_n\rangle$.

## Two bit gates

### CNOT gate

$CNOT = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

Explanation: $CNOT|00\rangle = |00\rangle$, $CNOT|01\rangle = |01\rangle$, $CNOT|10\rangle = |11\rangle$, $CNOT|11\rangle = |10\rangle$. Control not. If the first qubit is $1$, then flip the second qubit.

## Non-cloning theorem

It is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state.

Proof: $U |0\rangle|0\rangle = |0\rangle|0\rangle$ and $U |1\rangle|0\rangle = |1\rangle|1\rangle$.

So $U |+\rangle|0\rangle = U \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle|0\rangle + |1\rangle|1\rangle)$, not $|+\rangle|+\rangle$.
