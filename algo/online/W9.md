# Week 9

## Secretary problem

$n$ candidate arrive one by one in a random order, assigned with a rank $r_i$.

You have only $2$ choices:

- Accept the candidate and stop the process.
- Reject the candidate and move to the next one.

### Wait and pick

reject first $50 \%$ candidates, then pick the first candidate that is better than all previous candidates.

it is at least $4$-competitive.

proof:

50% probability that the second best candidate is in the first half, and the best candidate is in the second half.

When both happen, the algorithm is $4$-competitive.

#### Improvement

reject first $1/e$ candidates, then pick the first candidate that is better than all previous candidates.

win case:

1. the best candidate is after the first $1/e$ candidates.
2. suppose $m = n / e$, at position $x$ ($x > m$), win when $r_{m + 1}, \cdots r_{x - 1} < \min{r_1 \cdots r_m}$.

### Variation: Matching problem

Given $U, some $n$ candidates arrive one by one, each with some edges to $U$, with a rank $r_i$ on each edge.

Find the maximum matching.

(When $|U| = 1$, it is the secretary problem.)
