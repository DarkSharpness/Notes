## Contents

routing protocols (BGP) ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol))

software-defined networking (SDN) (Software + Hardware)

## Misc

Network layer function:

- forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output
- routing: determine route taken by packets from source to destination

Data plane

- local, per-router function
- determines how datagrams arriving on router's input port are forwarded to router's output port

Control plane

- network-wide logic -> routing algorithms
- determines how datagram is forwarded among routers along end-end path from source host to destination host

Memory / Bus / Crossbar

- crossbar: interconnection network

> inter: between objects. intra: within objects
