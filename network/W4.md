运输层: 进程到进程

网络层: 主机到主机 <-- 最复杂的一层

链路层: 子网内部连接, node 2 node, 不依赖路由器直接传输

物理层: 物理的导线传播

## What are the requirements for the Internet

- scalability
- manageability

## Phyical Layer

- 提供传输 Bit 的方法
- 定义了 mechanical, electrical, timing interfaces to the network

objective of communication

- fast(delay + bandwidth)
- correctness (error)
- low cost(energy, money, frequency resource)

challenges:

- attenuation (衰减)
- multipath fading (多径衰落)
- dopper effect (多普勒效应)
- interference (干扰)
...
(core: 你发送的信号, 那边接收到的可能不一样)

bandwith of a signal: measure of the extent of the significant spectral content of the signal for positive frequencies ($f_{max} - f_{min}$)

Information, message:

- analog: voice, voltage
- digital: 0, 1 (text, image, video)

source -> channel -> destination (just one link)

...

### Tranmission analog signal

- baseband signal: a signal that has not been modulated or has been demodulated to its original frequency range (often include signal from 0 Hz)
- passband signal: the range of signal frequencies that are allowed to pass through a filter without being attenuated. (filter out high/low frequency)
