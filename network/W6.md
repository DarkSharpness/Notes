EDC: error detection and correction

## Misc 面向连接

- point to point: 1 -> 1
- broadcast: 1 -> all
- multicast: 1 -> many (may not be all)
- convergecast: many -> 1

## packet sending

stop and wait: wait for acceptance of packet before sending next packet

go back n: sender send $n$ (windows) packets at once. The receiver send the largest accepted packet number. If the sender does not receive the acknowledgment, it will resend the packet.

selective repeat: sender send $n$ packets at once. The receiver send the largest accepted packet number. If the sender does not receive the acknowledgment, it will resend the packet.

## TCP overview

with connection: we may accept 1 port and have multiple connections (within 1 port). the kernel will forward the packet to the correct connection.

full duplex data: data can be sent in both directions at the same time.

connection-oriented: 3-way handshake to establish connection, 4-way handshake to close connection. (维护状态信息, 为了提供比 network 更多的 control)

- congestion control

the header:

- source port
- destination port
- sequence number (byte number)
- acknowledgment number
- header length
- flags
